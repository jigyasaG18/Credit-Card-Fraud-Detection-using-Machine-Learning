# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

## Introduction

### Background
Credit card fraud has become a prevalent issue in today's digital economy, where financial transactions are increasingly conducted online. The rapid increase in digital transactions has unfortunately been paralleled by a rise in fraudulent activities. This not only leads to significant financial losses for consumers and financial institutions but also undermines consumer trust in electronic payment systems. As a result, effective fraud detection systems are crucial for safeguarding financial transactions.

## Dataset Overview

### Source of Data
The dataset used in this project is a record of credit card transactions comprising **284,807 entries**. It includes numerous features derived from financial transactions while anonymizing user information to protect privacy.

### Features Description
Each transaction is characterized by several features:
- **Time**: The time elapsed since the first transaction.
- **V1 to V28**: Anonymized features generated through Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
- **Amount**: The monetary value of the transaction.
- **Class**: A binary label where `0` indicates a legitimate transaction and `1` denotes a fraudulent transaction.

### Class Distribution
A notable characteristic of the dataset is the **class imbalance**:
- Legitimate transactions (Class `0`): **284,315**
- Fraudulent transactions (Class `1`): **492**

This imbalance can complicate model training, as traditional classification models may become biased towards the majority class.

## Data Preprocessing

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Initial exploratory data analysis is performed to obtain insights from the dataset, including:
1. **Statistical Summary**: Describes the central tendency and variability of transaction amounts for both legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
2. **Class Distribution Visualization**: Helps visualize the imbalance between the two classes.

### Handling Class Imbalance
To address the class imbalance, an under-sampling technique is employed:
- **Under-Sampling**: A random sample of 492 legitimate transactions is taken to match the quantity of fraudulent transactions, creating a balanced dataset that minimizes bias during model training.

## Model Training and Evaluation

### Algorithm Choice
The project employs a **Logistic Regression** model, a straightforward yet effective algorithm for binary classification tasks. Logistic Regression computes the probability of a transaction being fraudulent based on the linear combination of the input features.

### Data Splitting
The balanced dataset is divided into training and testing sets, ensuring that both classes are proportionally represented in each subset through stratified sampling. This helps evaluate the model effectively.

### Training the Model
The Logistic Regression model is then trained on the training data. The model learns the relationship between the features and their respective class labels.

### Model Evaluation Metrics
The model's performance is assessed using accuracy as the primary metric:
- **Accuracy**: This is the ratio of correctly predicted instances (both legitimate and fraudulent) to the total predictions made.

### Results and Accuracy
The Logistic Regression model achieved:
- **Training Accuracy**: Approximately **94.79%** – suggesting that the model effectively recognized patterns in the training data.
- **Test Accuracy**: Approximately **93.40%** – indicating the model's capacity to generalize well to unseen data.

While these accuracy scores are commendable, it is essential to treat accuracy cautiously, especially in datasets with imbalanced classes. For this reason, additional metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score should also be considered in a real-world setting to ensure that the model effectively identifies fraudulent transactions without generating excessive false positives.

## Challenges and Considerations

### Class Imbalance Issues
The skewed distribution of classes raises concerns about the model's effectiveness in detecting fraud. High accuracy in a heavily imbalanced dataset may be misleading; thus, it's vital to assess model performance with additional metrics that better reflect the model’s capability in distinguishing the minority class.

### Data Privacy and Security
Given the sensitivity of credit card transaction data, the anonymization of features is fundamental. Continuous data protection measures should be in place, especially in production environments.

## Conclusion

The project clearly demonstrates the potential of machine learning in revolutionizing fraud detection mechanisms in financial transactions. The Logistic Regression model performed adeptly, achieving high accuracy in both training and testing phases. However, as fraud techniques continue to evolve, ongoing refinement and testing of the model against new data sets will be essential for maintaining its accuracy and effectiveness. Future work could explore advanced algorithms such as Random Forests or Neural Networks to potentially boost predictive performance and reliability.
